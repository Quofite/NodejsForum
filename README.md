# Simple forum on Node.js
Simple forum made as learning project.
I already made such thing, but it was on PHP and had many bugs with small amount of features and low database defense.
Now this is a substantial thing, that can be grow into something bigger than learning project.

It uses such frameworks and features like Express.js, MySQL, AJAX and Bootstrap.
Probably it will be hosted on Heroku or something.

# What do you need to know before use:
1) Rename EXAMPLE-smth.js just to smth.js and add yours data about db(host, pass etc.)

2) Messages are updating every 5 seconds and there are 1 bug, that when user only entered forum, he needs to 5 seconds too

3) I'm working alone, so solving bugs can take some time
