# Simple forum on Node.js
Simple forum made as learning project.
I already made such thing, but it was on PHP and had many bugs with small amount of features and low database defense.
Now this is a substantial thing, that can be grow into something bigger than learning project.

It uses such frameworks and features like Express.js, MySQL and AJAX
Probably it will be hosted on Heroku or something.
